# chart-bench

The same two charts — a survival curve with confidence bands and censoring ticks, and a sized scatter plot — built in seven ways and measured the same way:

| arm | renderer |
| --- | --- |
| `none` | React + d3-scale, hand-written SVG (the baseline) |
| `nivo` | nivo (SVG) |
| `recharts` | Recharts (SVG) |
| `echarts` | Apache ECharts (Canvas) |
| `visx` | visx (SVG primitives) |
| `tanstack` | TanStack Charts |
| `chartjs` | Chart.js (Canvas) |

Every arm draws the same thing; [`apps/bench/ARMS.md`](apps/bench/ARMS.md) is the contract each port was written against, and each arm's `NOTES.md` records what the library did natively, what had to be composed, and what had to be hand-drawn.

## Method

**Data.** Seeded generators (`apps/bench/src/data/generate.ts`, splitmix32), so every library gets byte-identical input. All data is synthetic.

| dataset | survival | scatter |
| --- | --- | --- |
| typical | 3 series × 200 points | 500 points |
| heavy | 6 series × 1,000 points | 10,000 points |

**Mount time** — [`packages/bench-stage`](packages/bench-stage). The chart is not rendered on page load; the runner calls `window.benchStage.mount()`, so module evaluation and hydration are excluded. The clock stops two animation frames after the chart reports done, which puts it after the browser has painted.

- SVG arms report done when React commits (`raf` mode).
- Canvas arms report done from the library's own "rendered" event (`signal` mode) — otherwise the timer would stop on a blank canvas.
- Both modes go through the **same** double-rAF before the mark. Marking immediately on the signal stops the clock before paint and hands every Canvas library a free frame.

The double rAF makes the instrument frame-quantised: an empty `shell` page measures ≈ 1.4 frames. Differences under one frame (≈ 16.7 ms at 60 Hz) are noise.

**Hover** — the pointer sweeps the chart in 60 steps while a rAF loop records frame gaps; the reported number is the longest gap. Also frame-quantised.

**DOM nodes** — elements inside the chart container after mount. Diagnostic: Canvas arms report a handful.

**Bundle** — gzipped JS + CSS each arm's entry loads, from Vite's build manifest, minus the `shell` entry (same page, no chart library) = *library cost*.

**Runs** — production build (`vite build` + `vite preview`), headless Chromium via Playwright, one worker, one warm-up then 9 measured page loads per cell. Reported as median ± half the IQR. Never mean, never p95.

## Run it

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build                # also writes apps/bench/results/bundle.json
pnpm bench                # BENCH_ARMS=none,nivo BENCH_REPEATS=9 to narrow
pnpm report               # results/report.md
```

Close everything else first: a dev server or a browser tab in the background moves every number.
